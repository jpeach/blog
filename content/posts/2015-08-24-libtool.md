I’m considering taking back all the bad things I have said about
[libtool](http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/libtool.html)
It turns out that by using
[libltdl](http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/libtool.html#Using-libltdl)
it is possible to generate plugins that can be built a statically or as
shared objects. I know it’s not too bad to implement that in a custom
build, but as I understood more about `libtool`, this turns out to
be relatively clean.

[This](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/building_shared_libraries_once_using_autotools)
is the best introduction to using `libltdl` that I have found.
