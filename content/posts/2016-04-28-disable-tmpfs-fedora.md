Well, Fedora 23 seems to default to placing `/tmp` in a tiny `tmpfs` volume, which easily fills, breaking things you need, like `dnf`.

Fairly annoying, but the fix, from the [wiki page](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/tmp-on-tmpfs) is straightforward:

    % sudo systemctl mask tmp.mount
    % sudo reboot
