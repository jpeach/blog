I spent a while trying to debug a runc problem where it would always get
an `EACCES` error writing the `cpu.cfs_period_us` file in a cpu cgroup.

The problem turned out to be that I had not enabled `CONFIG_CFS_BANDWIDTH`
in my kernel build. Presumably, when runc tries to write the file,
it passes `O_CREAT` and cgroupfs doesnâ€™t let it create a new file,
which leads to the somewhat surprising error.

So, if you get this error, just turn on `CONFIG_CFS_BANDWIDTH` :)
