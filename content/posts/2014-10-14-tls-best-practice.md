Well after groveling around trying to find documentation on the right way to configure TLS, I came up with

*   [NIST guidelines](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-52r1.pdf) (thanks Wikipedia)
*   [TLS Recommendations](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-uta-tls-bcp-05) BCP (draft)

Just stashing these link here for next time ...
